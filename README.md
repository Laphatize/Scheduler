# Scheduler
An advance adaptation of Penn State's Schedule Builder program with custom events - built by students

## Work in progress

Combination of Penn State's Schedulebuilder and Google Calendar's schedule-planning interface in one combined planner, that uses easy live-updated class status API - from lionpath-schedulebuilder - and custom events to build schedules based around the student's classes. This will reduce the course planning delays and hassle of creating custom schedules.
- Built by Penn State Students

API comm, custom schedule planning, faster decisions, better time-management
